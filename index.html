                           Cuba is my native country, where I grew up and where my closest relatives and friends are, a
                           country of beaches, rum, tobacco, and beautiful women, a country where you ear since you are
                           born that education and healthcare are free. Still, Cuba hides many secrets for those who
                           look
                           from the outside. Education and health are paid not only with the hopes of each Cuban but
                           with
                           more than 95% of their salary;

                  to prison for my ideas, the first time I was carefree. In my mind, there was no stress because I
                  was going to eat my family the next day. Mexico was my door to freedom and extremely spicy food :)

                     describe it with a single

                     lot), Cuban food, Cuban coffee, beach, sun, parties, and domino tournaments. But I wanted to learn
                     English, and it is easier to find snow in Miami than someone to speak English to. So although I
                     enjoyed my time there, I left to where I could practice my English but not so far that I would be
                     freezing all year.</p>
