                     Cuba is my native country, where I grew up and where my closest relatives and friends are, a
                     country
                     of beaches, rum, tobacco, and beautiful women, a country where you ear since you are born that
                     education and healthcare are free. Still, Cuba hides many secrets for those who look from the
                     outside.
                     Education and health are paid not only with the hopes of each Cuban but with more than 95% of their

                     salary; the average salary for a surgeon, to mention an example, is only 35 dollars a month.
                     Moreover,
                     the Pearl of the Caribbean, as someone baptized it, today is the home of the most bloodthirsty
                     dictators that this hemisphere has known, who until to this date repress, imprison, disappear and
                     exile all those who think differently or speak of freedom or democracy.

                  <p>Mexico was the first country to which I could escape from the Cuban dictatorship, the first time I
                     savored freedom and what it felt like to say and do whatever I wanted without worrying about going
                     to prison for my ideas, the first time I was carefree. In my mind, there was no stress because I
                     was going to eat my family the next day. Mexico was my door to freedom and extremely spicy food :).

                  <p>Miami was the first place I arrived in the United States. If I had to describe it with a single
                     word would be "wow", anything a Cuban would need to be happy is there: a lot of Cubans (really, a
                     lot), Cuban food, Cuban coffee, beach, sun, parties, and domino tournaments. But I wanted to learn
                     English, and it is easier to find snow in Miami than someone to speak English to. So although I
                     enjoyed my time there, I left to where I could practice my English but not so far that I would be
                     freezing all year.</p>
